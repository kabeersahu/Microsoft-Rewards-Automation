# **Automated Microsoft Rewards Script**

### **üöÄ Project Goal: The Smart Way to Earn Rewards**

This Python script is designed to automate Microsoft Rewards by leveraging a clever approach. A single PC can manage multiple accounts using separate Chrome user profiles, making each session appear as a unique user. My solution goes beyond simple automation‚Äîit mimics human behavior with realistic delays and actions to avoid detection and potential account bans. This is a project that showcases my skills in web automation, security thinking, and robust tool-building.

### **üß† How It Works: A Realistic Automation Flow**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step visual guide to the script's process.

**1\. Set Up & Clean Up**

* **Launch**: You start the zhel.py script.  
* **Process Check**: It first automatically finds and shuts down any leftover Chrome windows that might be running. This keeps things clean and error-free.

**2\. Data & Accounts**

* **Data Source**: The script pulls a list of search queries from your Excel file (Book1.xlsx).  
* **Multi-Profile Loop**: It cycles through each of your designated Chrome user profiles, one at a time.

**3\. Human-Like Execution**

* **Navigate**: For each profile, the script opens a new browser window.  
* **Realistic Search**: It performs searches using these advanced techniques:  
  * **Time Lag**: It adds a random delay between each search to simulate a person's natural pause.  
  * **Scroll Simulation**: It scrolls down the page to mimic a user looking at the results.

**4\. The End**

* **Cycle Complete**: After finishing all the searches for one account, it closes the browser and moves on to the next one.

### **üåü Core Strengths**

| Feature | Why It's Impressive |
| :---- | :---- |
| ‚úÖ **Multi-Account Support** | Demonstrates experience managing complex workflows across multiple user sessions. |
| ‚úÖ **Realistic User Simulation** | Highlights an understanding of anti-bot measures and the ability to build robust, undetectable tools. |
| ‚úÖ **Data-Driven & Scalable** | Shows how to manage content (search queries) separately from the code for easy scaling and updates. |
| ‚úÖ **Automated Process Management** | Proves attention to detail and a focus on building a reliable, self-sufficient tool that doesn't rely on manual intervention. |
| ‚úÖ **Strong Error Handling** | The script is designed to be resilient and won't crash when faced with unexpected web page layouts. |

### **‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started**

1. **Clone the Repository:** Download the project files.  
2. **Install Dependencies:** Run this command in your terminal to get everything you need:  
   pip install selenium openpyxl psutil

3. **Update Paths:** In zhel.py, you'll need to set the file paths for your ChromeDriver and Chrome user profiles.  
4. **Add Your Data:** Put your search terms in the Book1.xlsx file.  
5. **Run the Script:** Open your terminal in the project folder and run:  
   python zhel.py

### **üìÇ Project Files**

* zhel.py: The core automation script.  
* Book1.xlsx: The Excel file with your search queries.  
* New Microsoft Word Document.docx: The document containing the email and password lists for the different accounts.
